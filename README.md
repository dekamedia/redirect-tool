# redirect-tool
WordPress Plugin to send users to different URLs. 

The idea is that the user visits a URL and is then redirected to one of the different URLs that are being set up in the plugin.

Each of the destination URLs should be assigned a weighting factor from 1-5. 

According to this factor, the plugin chooses which final destination URL is called.
